<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! 👋 I’m Tanu Sharma, a B.Tech Computer Science student and a creative soul with a strong passion for web development. My journey in tech started with a simple curiosity about how websites work, and it quickly grew into a love for designing and building solutions that make life easier—and look good while doing it.
</p>

<p>I thrive at the intersection of logic and creativity, whether I’m debugging a tricky piece of code or crafting seamless user experiences. For me, every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

<h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
<p>✨ I’m currently learning Spanish because why limit communication to just one language?<br>
  ✨ When I’m not coding, I’m likely indulging in my newfound love for crochet, creating something beautiful stitch by stitch.<br>
  ✨ As a Scorpio with an Aquarius sun, I bring a mix of passion, innovation, and an unyielding drive to everything I do.</p>
<h2>My Developer Toolbox</h2>
<p>💻 Front-End: Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with experience in frameworks like React to bring ideas to life.<br>
🛠 Problem-Solving: Whether it’s optimizing performance or debugging complex code, I love the challenge of finding elegant solutions<br>
🌐 User-Centric Design: I prioritize creating intuitive, accessible, and responsive designs that connect with users on every device.</p>
<h2>What Drives Me</h2>
<p>I believe technology is more than just code; it’s a medium to connect people, solve problems, and tell stories. My work reflects my commitment to creating digital experiences that matter.

  Let’s build something meaningful together. 🚀</p>
